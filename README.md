# DenseNet on MURA Dataset using Keras


A Keras implementation(refer to [this repositoy](https://github.com/tdeboissiere/DeepLearningImplementations/tree/master/DenseNet)) of 169 layer [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) model on [MURA dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06957)

Train the model with `run_MURA.py`

Please add `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` to head of each file for there are annotations not coded in ASCII.
